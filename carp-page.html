            <p class="explanation">For my first design, repetition of the black and white colouring for all the text and logos indicates that it is all quite relevant information and ties it together despite being on opposite sides of the poster. I switched the two colours around for the bottom portion of text to add contrast to the poster so that itâ€™s not boring all being the same exact pattern. The clear contrast between the black and white of the text and its background to have the information easier to read and to make it stand out more. I have the sponsor aligned on the right-hand side of the poster away from the main title and informative text to separate it as it is its own information. This goes with the proximity too. I aligned the text in the bottom box to separate the information into two distinct positions, adding distance between them. As well as have different font weights and size to add contrast between the two.</p>

        <div class="poster-two">

            <p class="explanation"> I used many of the same concepts in this design as I did the first, mainly the repetition of the font colour. In this design I added diagonal separating lines between the images and text, this repetition creates a theme for the divided content to make it feel more natural to create a more exciting way of separating sections. The repetition of images of balloons ingrains the idea of balloons so readers easily know what us being advertised. The alignment of the text along the left-hand side, going from top to bottom gives the viewer of the poster a clear direction of which direction to go when reading the text. Proximity is used to separate the different parts of the poster with the important text being group together to the top left, the balloon images all grouped in the center and the sponsors for the event grouped in the bottom right. </p>

            </a>
            <p class="explanation">My final design is quite different from the first two. The text is aligned in the center of the poster to create with the width of it coming out wider at the bottom and thinner at the top to create almost and arrow shape from the largest piece of text being the title. This shape creates a clear path for the reader top follow, starting at the largest title that catches the readers eye then leading them upwards to read the rest of the poster. The repetition of all the hot air balloon has the same affect as mentioned in the last design. The positioning of the text, all being in equal distance as it goes up shows good proximity between. The contrast between the text situated in the bottom and center gives good contrast between the rest of the empty space on the poster creating a almost more dynamic poster.</p>
